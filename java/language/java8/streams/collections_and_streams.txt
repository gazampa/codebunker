Collections and streams, while bearing some superficial similarities, have different goals. 
Collections are primarily concerned with the efficient management of, and access to, their elements.
By contrast, streams do not provide a means to directly access or manipulate their elements, and are instead concerned 
with declaratively describing their source and the computational operations which will be performed in aggregate on that source. 
However, if the provided stream operations do not offer the desired functionality, the BaseStream.iterator() 
and BaseStream.spliterator() operations can be used to perform a controlled traversal.
