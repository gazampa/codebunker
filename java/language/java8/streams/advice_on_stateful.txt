Stateful ops can be implemented by extracting a stream's Spliterator, wrapping it into a custom one 
and rewrapping it into a new stream, but in this case that seems hardly appropriate considering that this 
would essentially be all what your stream pipeline does.

Since you're trying to run a stateful and parallelizable compute task you might want to look into 
the fork-join framework or CompletableFuture instead. The former is also used as part of the 
parallel stream implementation and the latter make it easier to compose computations and their results.
